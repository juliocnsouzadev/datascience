# Linear Algebrar Library

### Much like we can on numbers, we can perform arithmetic operations using points and vectors.

In this library you find functions applicable to solving computational geometry problems in two- or three-dimensional space: for example, finding the midpoint of two points or finding the shortest distance from a point to a line.
